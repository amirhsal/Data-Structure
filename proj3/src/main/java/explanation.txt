Hi,

This is first time I am using grace period. I m using the grace period to submit for gold points. In the beginning I wasn't sure if I want to continue for the gold points, but I notice we still can try it in grace period.

In Gradescope showing my explanation is not enough.
I am not sure how long should be proper for explanation.

Thanks.
